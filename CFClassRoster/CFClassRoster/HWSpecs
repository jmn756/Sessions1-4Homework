Sessions 2,3,4 -- Homework: Roster App

Session2:

Drag out 2 buttons and label on your initial view controller
Create actions for the 2 buttons, and an outlet for the label
Create an array of 5 strings and store it in a property on your view controller
Implement an algorithm that cycles through strings in the array as you press the buttons, showing a different string in the label.

Session 3:

Wipe out the work you did for the session 2 homework.
Add a table view to your interface. It should take up the entire screen. Use autolayout like I did in class to ensure this.
Show an array of strings in the table view. Follow the same steps I did in the slides/sample code.

Session 4:

Add a Person class to your Model layer. This class should contain properties for firstName and lastName
Convert your table view to show an array of these person objects
upon selecting on a cell, segue to a detail view controller, and show the selected person's firstName and lastName in separate labels.
I want the firstName label to be dead center in the screen, and then the lastName label right below it, centered as well.
